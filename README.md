## Description

An experimental `rooster` object has been developed without any tests! Itâ€™s up to you to write them.

By the end of this project, you will have a fast, complete, reliable, isolated, maintainable, and expressive test suite: it will provide confidence that the `rooster` is functioning correctly and it will act as a form of documentation for other developers.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow the steps below:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.js` file to find the definition of the `rooster` object.
3. Write a test suite in the `index_test.js` file within the `test` directory.
4. Use the [Mocha test framework](https://mochajs.org/) and [assert methods](https://nodejs.org/api/assert.html) from the Node.js standard library.
5. Refer to the linked documentation if you are unsure about any of the methods.

## Usage

Follow the instructions below to use the `rooster` object and the test suite:

1. Run the tests using the command `npm test` in the root directory of the project.
2. The test suite will evaluate the functionality of the `rooster` object and provide feedback on its correctness.
3. Use the test suite as a form of documentation to understand how to use and interact with the `rooster` object.
